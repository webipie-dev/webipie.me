    <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br>
    <p>Webipie started as a dream shared between four software engineering students.<br>
      <br>
      It all began when we noticed the huge importance of having a website portfolio for landing a job in today's market.
      However, to build your own portfolio from scratch would <strong>require effort and days of hard work.</strong><br>
      <br>
      So we gathered around the four of us and decided to spend a couple of months creating a portfolio website builder
      that'll <strong>grant you a portfolio in minutes.</strong>
